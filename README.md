Automation
==========

This is a small project. The intended purpose of this library is only educational. It is supposed to show how different abstract machines work and how they could be represented. Because of the large number of such machines, only a small portion is going to be implemented, but more are going to be added.

##Instalation
``` go
import "github.com/ytsvetkov/Automation"
